# Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Test-a-BLE.

## Short-term (0.2.0)
- [ ] Add support for BLE device simulation for testing without physical devices
- [ ] Improve error handling and reporting
- [ ] Add more examples for common BLE devices
- [ ] Convert to pytest plugin, or add support for that?

## Medium-term (0.3.0)
- [ ] Add a web-based UI for test execution and results visualization
- [ ] Support for test result export in various formats (JSON, CSV, HTML)
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD systems

## Long-term (1.0.0)
- [ ] Support for automated BLE device discovery and identification
- [ ] Machine learning-based anomaly detection in BLE device behavior
- [ ] Support for complex test scenarios with multiple BLE devices
